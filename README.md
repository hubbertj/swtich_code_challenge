#Problem

Please follow the principals of www.csszengarden.com, by modifying the CSS of www.switch.com in any way you wish.  Make changes which you feel may be more (or less) functional, more (or less) pretty or useful, “invigorated with fashion”, animated, stylized, or whatever you like.   Feel free to include an explanation of why you made the changes you did, especially if you made changes that are "less" functional, pretty or useful.  Most of all, have fun with it!   Please make sure you read, understand and abide by www.csszengarden.com and its listed “participation”, “benefits” and “requirements”.   The only difference here is that we want you to modify the CSS of www.switch.com and not that of www.csszengarden.com.
